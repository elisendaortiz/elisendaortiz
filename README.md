# Hi, I'm Elis 👋 

I am a Data Scientist / ML engineer 🌴.</br>
I earned my PhD in Physics of Complex Networks from University of Barcelona (UB) where I conducted research at the intersection of physics, dynamical systems and computer science. My work there, focused on developing the foundations and applications of Network Geometry to model complex patterns in real network datasets. What people nowadays call graph embeddings --> yes, that. You can visit my [personal website](https://elisendaortiz.github.io/) for a full academic bio.

Recently I founded [Karabao Studios](https://karabaostudios.com/), a consulting firm where I help Data & AI professionals find clarity and direction through Strategy —for their careers, startups, and ventures. A great excuse to make good use of my biggest skill: foreseeing whith annoying clarity when/why/how things won't work.

Aside from being a nerd, I'm an avid traveler and an aventure-sports enthusiast 🏄🏼‍♂️🌺
