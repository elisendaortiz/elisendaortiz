# About me

I am a PhD candidate at the Dept. of Condensed Matter Physics at University of Barcelona (UB) working on Complex Networks. I do mostly research at the intersection of physics, dynamical systems and computer science. In particular my work focuses on developing the foundations and applications of Network Geometry to model complex patterns in real networks.

I also work as a Course designer at Gauss-Online Academy https://gaussonline.com/ and I'm an avid tarveler and aventure sports enthusiast.
