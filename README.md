# About me

I earned my PhD in Physics of Complex Networks from University of Barcelona (UB) where I still do freelance research at the intersection of physics, dynamical systems and computer science. M work there focuses on developing the foundations and applications of Network Geometry to model complex patterns in real networks. In addition, I'm currently expanding my skill set to ultimately transition to the world of Data Science. 

I also work as a Course designer at Gauss-Online https://gaussonline.com/ and I'm an avid traveler and aventure sports enthusiast.
