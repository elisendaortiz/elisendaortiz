# About me

I earned my PhD in Physics of Complex Networks from University of Barcelona (UB) where I do research mostly at the intersection of physics, dynamical systems and computer science. In particular my current work focuses on developing the foundations and applications of Network Geometry to model complex patterns in real networks.

I also work as a Course designer at Gauss-Online https://gaussonline.com/ and I'm an avid traveler and aventure sports enthusiast.
