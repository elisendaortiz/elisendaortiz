# About me

I am a 🌴 Data Scientist in transition to ML engineer.</br> 
I earned my PhD in Physics of Complex Networks from University of Barcelona (UB) where I conducted research at the intersection of physics, dynamical systems and computer science. My work there, focused on developing the foundations and applications of Network Geometry to model complex patterns in real networks. You can visit my [personal website](https://elisendaortiz.github.io/) for a full academic bio.

Aside from being a nerd, I'm an avid traveler and an aventure-sports enthusiast 🏄🏼‍♂️🌺
