# About me

I am a Data Scientist / Mathematical Modeller at [VesselsValue Ltd.](https://www.vesselsvalue.com/) where I happily grow day by day my machine learning skills while addressing interesting real problems that affect the maritime and aviation sectors. I earned my PhD in Physics of Complex Networks from University of Barcelona (UB) where I conducted research at the intersection of physics, dynamical systems and computer science. My work there focused on developing the foundations and applications of Network Geometry to model complex patterns in real networks. You can visit my [personal website](https://elisendaortiz.github.io/) for a full academic bio.

Aside from being a nerd, I'm an avid traveler and an aventure sports enthusiast.
