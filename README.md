# About me

I earned my PhD in Physics of Complex Networks from University of Barcelona (UB) where I still do freelance research at the intersection of physics, dynamical systems and computer science. My work there focuses on developing the foundations and applications of Network Geometry to model complex patterns in real networks. Currently, I am mostly focused on mastering my machine learning skills to become a super solid Data Scientist.

I also sporadically work as a Course designer at Gauss-Online https://gaussonline.com/ and I'm an avid traveler and aventure sports enthusiast.
